## Dev Test Project

[Documentation](https://docs.webchaos.dev/)

We're creating two components seen here: 
https://www.figma.com/file/OyqUK4wuFu3PzdSEeU6CG4/Dev-Sample?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev

Colors and a basic database have been added. All that's required to get this up and running is a clone then "make dev" then "make import". ENV - just clone the example file as ".env" no changes needed for this example.

Components: 
- Modify "feature_3_columns_with_icons"
- Create "hero_split_with_video"

See how other components are setup and clone a component to make the new one.

Instructions: 
- Clone this repo and rename it "vessul-dev-test-[your-name]"
- Add the fonts required for this project (available free online, one is already there)
- Add each component as a new commit
- Page with new components called "components"
- Run "Make export" to save your databse changes as a new backup
